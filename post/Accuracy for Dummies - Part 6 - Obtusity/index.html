<p><a href="/post/Accuracy for Dummies - Part 5 - Convexity/">Last time</a> we saw that the set of probability assignments is <em>convex</em>. Today we&rsquo;re going to show that convex sets have a special sort of &ldquo;obtuse&rdquo; relationship with outsiders. Given a point <em>outside</em> a convex set, there is always a point <em>in</em> the set that forms a right-or-obtuse angle with it.</p>

<p>Recall our 2D diagram from the first post. The convex set of interest here is the diagonal line segment from $(0,1)$ to $(1,0)$:</p>

<p><img src="/img/accuracy/2D Dominance Diagram - 400px.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>For any point outside the diagonal, like $c^* $, there is a point like $c&rsquo;$ on it that forms a right angle with all other points on the diagonal. As a result, $c&rsquo;$ is closer to all other points on the diagonal than $c^* $ is. In particular, $c&rsquo;$ is closer to both vertices, so it&rsquo;s always more accurate than $c^*$. It&rsquo;s &ldquo;closer to the truth&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The insider point $c&rsquo;$ that we used in this case is the closest point on the diagonal to $c^*$. That&rsquo;s what licenses the right-triangle reasoning here. Today we&rsquo;re generalizing this strategy to $n$ dimensions.</p>

<p>To do that, we need some tools for reasoning about $n$-dimensional geometry.$

<h1 id="arithmetic-with-arrows">Arithmetic with Arrows</h1>

<p>You&rsquo;re familiar with arithmetic in one dimension: adding, subtracting, and multiplying single numbers. What about points in $n$ dimensions?</p>

<p>We introduced two ideas for arithmetic with points last time. We&rsquo;ll add a few more today, and also talk about what they mean geometrically.</p>

<p>Suppose you have two points $\x$ and $\y$ in $n$ dimensions:
  $$
  \begin{align}
    \x &amp;= (x_1, \ldots, x_n),\\<br />
    \y &amp;= (y_1, \ldots, y_n).
  \end{align}
  $$
Their sum $\x + \y$, as we saw last time, is defined as follows:
  $$ \x + \y = (x_1 + y_1, \ldots, x_n + y_n). $$
In other words, points are added coordinate-wise.</p>

<p>This definition has a natural, geometric meaning we didn&rsquo;t mention last time. Start by thinking of $\x$ and $\y$ as <em>vectors</em>&mdash;as arrows pointing from the origin to the points $\x$ and $\y$. Then $\x + \y$ just amounts to putting the two arrows end-to-point and taking the point at the end:
<img src="/img/accuracy/VectorAddition.png" alt="" />
(Notice that we&rsquo;re continuing our usual practice of bold letters for points/vectors like $\x$ and $\y$, and italics for single numbers like $x_1$ and $y_3$.)</p>

<p>You can also multiply a vector $\x$ by a single number, $a$. The definition is once again coordinate-wise:
  $$ a \x = (a x_1, \ldots, a x_n). $$
And again there&rsquo;s a natural, geometric meaning. We&rsquo;ve lengthened the vector $\x$ by a factor of $a$.
<img src="/img/accuracy/VectorMultiplication.png" alt="" />
Notice that if $a$ is between $0$ and $1$, then &ldquo;lengthening&rdquo; is actually shortening. For example, multiplying a vector by $a = 1/ 2$ makes it half as long.</p>

<p>If $a$ is negative, then multiplying by $a$ reverses the direction of the arrow. For example, multiplying the northeasterly arrow $(1,1)$ by $-1$ yields the southwesterly arrow pointing to $(-1,-1)$.</p>

<p>That means we can define subtraction in terms of addition and multiplication by negative one (just as with single numbers):
  $$
  \begin{align}
    \x - \y &amp;= \x + (-1 \times \y)\\<br />
            &amp;= (x_1 - y_1, \ldots, x_n - y_n).
  \end{align}
  $$
So vector subtraction amounts to coordinate-wise subtraction.</p>

<p>But what about multiplying two vectors? That&rsquo;s actually different from what you might expect! We don&rsquo;t just multiply coordinate-wise. We do that <strong>and then add up the results</strong>:
  $$ \x \cdot \y = x_1 y_1 + \ldots + x_n y_n. $$
So the product of two vectors is <strong>not a vector</strong>, but a number. That number is called the <em>dot product</em>, $\x \cdot \y$.</p>

<p>Why are dot products defined this way? Why do we add up the results of coordinate-wise multiplication to get a single number? Because it yields a more useful extension of the concept of multiplication from single numbers to vectors. We&rsquo;ll see part of that in a moment, in the geometric meaning of the dot product.</p>

<p>(There&rsquo;s an algebraic side to the story too, having to do with the axioms that characterize the real numbers&mdash;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)" target="_blank">the field axioms</a>. We won&rsquo;t go into that, but it comes out in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63HpaUFEtXY&amp;t=8m28s" target="_blank">this bit</a> of a beautiful lecture by Francis Su, especially around <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63HpaUFEtXY&amp;t=11m45s" target="_blank">the 11:45 mark</a>.)</p>

<h1 id="signs-and-their-significance">Signs and Their Significance</h1>

<p>In two dimensions, a right angle has a special algebraic property: the dot-product of two arrows making the angle is always zero.</p>

<p>Imagine a right triangle at the origin, with one leg going up to the point $(0,1)$ and the other leg going out to $(1,0)$:
<img src="/img/accuracy/VectorRightAngle.png" alt="" />
The dot product of those two vectors is $(1,0) \cdot (0,1) = 1 \times 0 + 0 \times 1 = 0$. One more example: consider the right angle formed by the vectors $(-3,3)$ and $(1,1)$.
<img src="/img/accuracy/VectorRightAngle2.png" alt="" />
Again, the dot product is $(-3,3) \cdot (1,1) = -3 \times 1 + 3 \times 1 = 0.$</p>

<p>Going a bit further: the dot product is always positive for acute angles, and negative for obtuse angles. Take the vectors $(5,0)$ and $(-1,1)$:
<img src="/img/accuracy/VectorObtuseAngle.png" alt="" />
Then we have $(5,0) \cdot (-1,1) = -5$. Whereas for $(5,0)$ and $(1,1)$:
<img src="/img/accuracy/VectorAcuteAngle.png" alt="" />
we find $(5,0) \cdot (1,1) = 5$.</p>

<p>So the sign of the dot-product reflects the angle formed by the vectors $\x$ and $\y$:</p>

<ul>
<li>acute angle: $\x \cdot \y &gt; 0$,</li>
<li>right angle: $\x \cdot \y = 0$,</li>
<li>obtuse angle: $\x \cdot \y &lt; 0$.</li>
</ul>

<p>That&rsquo;s going to be key in generalizing to $n$ dimensions, where reasoning with diagrams breaks down. But first, one last bit of groundwork.</p>

<h1 id="algebra-with-arrows">Algebra with Arrows</h1>

<p>You can check pretty easily that vector addition and multiplication behave a lot like ordinary addition and multiplication. The usual laws of commutativity, associativity, and distribution hold:</p>

<ul>
<li>$\x + \y = \y + \x$.</li>
<li>$\x + (\y + \z) = (\x + \y) + \z$.</li>
<li>$a ( \x + \y) = a\x + a\y$.</li>
<li>$\x \cdot \y = \y \cdot \x$.</li>
<li>$\x \cdot (\y + \z) = \x\y + \x\z$.</li>
<li>$a (\x \cdot \y) = a \x \cdot \y = \x \cdot a \y$.</li>
</ul>

<p>One notable consequence, which we&rsquo;ll use below, is the analogue of the familiar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOIL_method" target="_blank">&ldquo;FOIL method&rdquo;</a> from high school algebra:
  $$
  \begin{align}
    (\x - \y)^2 &amp;= (\x - \y) \cdot (\x - \y)\\<br />
                &amp;= \x^2 - 2 \x \cdot \y + \y^2.
  \end{align}
  $$
We&rsquo;ll also make use of the fact that the Brier distance between $\x$ and $\y$ can be written $(\x - \y)^2$. Why?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s write $\B(\x,\y)$ for the Brier distance between points $\x$ and $\y$. Recall the definition of Brier distance, which is just the square of Euclidean distance:
  $$ \B(\x,\y) = (x_1 - y_1)^2 + (x_2 - y_2)^2 + \ldots + (x_n - y_n)^2. $$
Now consider that, thanks to our definition of vector subtraction:
  $$ \x - \y = (x_1 - y_1, x_2 - y_2, \ldots, x_n - y_n). $$
And thanks to the definition of the dot product:
  $$ (\x - \y) \cdot (\x - \y) = (x_1 - y_1)^2 + (x_2 - y_2)^2 + \ldots (x_n - y_n)^2. $$
So $\B(\x, \y) = (\x - \y) \cdot (\x - \y)$, in other words:
  $$ \B(\x, \y) = (\x - y)^2. $$</p>

<h1 id="a-cute-lemma">A Cute Lemma</h1>

<p>Now we can prove the lemma that&rsquo;s the aim of this post. For the intuitive idea, picture a convex set $S$ in the plane, like a pentagon. Then choose an arbitrary point $\x$ outside that set:
<img src="/img/accuracy/ObtusityLemma.png" alt="" />
Now trace a straight line from $\x$ to the closest point of the convex region, $\y$:
<img src="/img/accuracy/ObtusityLemma2.png" alt="" />
Finally, trace another straight line to any other point $\z$ of $S$:
<img src="/img/accuracy/ObtusityLemma3.png" alt="" />
No matter what point we choose for $\z$, the angle formed will either be right or obtuse. It cannot be acute.</p>

<p><strong>Lemma.</strong> Let $S$ be a convex set of points in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Let $\x \not \in S$, and let $\y \in S$ minimize $\B(\y, \x)$ as a function of $\y$ on the domain $S$. Then for any $\z \in S$,
  $$ (\x - \y) \cdot (\z - \y) \leq 0. $$</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s pause to understand what the Lemma is saying before we dive into the proof.</p>

<p>Focus on the centered inequality. It&rsquo;s about the vectors $\x - \y$ and $\z - \y$. These are the arrows pointing from $\y$ to $\x$, and from $\y$ to $\z$. So in terms of our original two dimensional diagram with the triangle:
<img src="/img/accuracy/2D Dominance Diagram - 400px.png" alt="" />
we&rsquo;re looking at the angle between  $c^*$, $c&rsquo;$, and any point on the diagonal you like&hellip; which includes the ones we&rsquo;re especially interested in, the vertices. What the lemma tells us is that this angle is always at least a right angle.</p>

<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s exactly a right angle in this case, not an obtuse one. That&rsquo;s because our convex region is just the diagonal line. But the Lemma could also be applied to the whole triangular region in the diagram. That&rsquo;s a convex set too. And if we took a point inside the triangle as our third point, the angle formed would be obtuse. (This is actually important if you want to generalize the dominance theorem beyond what we&rsquo;ll prove next time. But for us it&rsquo;s just a mathematical extra.)</p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s prove the Lemma.</p>

<p><em>Proof.</em> Because $S$ is convex and $\y$ and $\z$ are in $S$, any mixture of $\y$ and $\z$ must also be in $S$. That is, every point $\lambda \z + (1-\lambda) \y$ is in $S$, given $0 \leq \lambda \leq 1$.</p>

<p>Notice that we can rewrite $\lambda \z + (1-\lambda) \y$ as follows:
  $$ \lambda \z + (1-\lambda) \y = \y + \lambda(\z - \y). $$
We&rsquo;ll use this fact momentarily.</p>

<p>Now, by hypothesis $\y$ is at least as close to $\x$ as any other point of $S$ is. So, in particular, $\y$ is at least as close to $\x$ as the mixtures of $\y$ and $\z$ are. Thus, for any given $\lambda \in [0,1]$:
  $$ \B(\y,\x) \leq \B(\lambda \z + (1-\lambda) \y, \x). $$
Using algebra, we can transform the right-hand side as follows:
  $$
  \begin{align}
    \B(\lambda \z + (1-\lambda) \y, \x) &amp;= \B(\x, \lambda \z + (1-\lambda) \y)\\<br />
      &amp;= \B(\x, \y + \lambda(\z - \y))\\<br />
      &amp;= (\x - (\y + \lambda(\z - \y)))^2\\<br />
      &amp;= ((\x - \y) - \lambda(\z - \y))^2\\<br />
      &amp;= (\x - \y)^2 + \lambda^2(\z - \y)^2 - 2\lambda(\x - \y) \cdot (\z - \y)\\<br />
      &amp;= \B(\x,\y) + \lambda^2\B(\z,\y) - 2\lambda(\x - \y) \cdot (\z - \y).
  \end{align}
  $$
Combining this equation with the previous inequality, we have:
  $$ \B(\y,\x) \leq \B(\x,\y) + \lambda^2\B(\z,\y) - 2\lambda(\x - \y) \cdot (\z - \y). $$
And because $\B(\y, \x) = \B(\x, \y)$, this becomes:<br />
  $$ 0 \leq \lambda^2\B(\z,\y) - 2\lambda(\x - \y) \cdot (\z - \y). $$
If we then restrict our attention to $\lambda &gt; 0$, we can divide and rearrange terms to get:
  $$ (\x - \y) \cdot (\z - \y) \leq \frac{\lambda\B(\z,\y)}{2}. $$
And since this inequality holds no matter how small $\lambda$ is, it follows that
  $$ (\x - \y) \cdot (\z - \y) \leq 0, $$
as desired.

<h1 id="taking-stock">Taking Stock</h1>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve got from this post and the last one:</p>

<ul>
<li>Last time: the set of probability functions $P$ is convex.</li>
<li>This time: given a point $\x$ outside $P$, there&rsquo;s a point $\y$ inside $P$ that forms a right-or-obtuse angle with every other point $\z$ in $P$.</li>
</ul>

<p>Intuitively, it should follow that:</p>

<ul>
<li>$\y$ is closer to every $\z$ in $P$ than $\x$ is.</li>
</ul>

<p>And indeed, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll show in the next post!</p>
