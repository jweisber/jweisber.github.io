<p>How much does a PhD from a prestigious program help you on the job
market in academic philosophy?</p>

<p>It makes a big difference to <em>where</em> you get a tenure-track job, if you
do get one (see
<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ergo/12405314.0005.010/--prestige-bias-an-obstacle-to-a-just-academic-philosophy?rgn=main;view=fulltext#4" target="_blank">here</a>).
It also seems to make some difference to <em>whether</em> you get a
tenure-track job (though maybe not as much as one might have thought:
see
<a href="http://placementdata.com:8182/the-philosophical-gourmet-report-and-placement/" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>

<p>But here I want to consider whether it makes a difference to <em>how long</em>
it takes to get a tenure-track job, if you do get one.</p>

<p>A priori I would have guessed a prestigious PhD shortens one&rsquo;s expected
time on the job market. But in some correspondence about my
<a href="https://jonathanweisberg.org/post/page-rank-1/" target="_blank">last</a>
<a href="https://jonathanweisberg.org/post/page-rank-2/" target="_blank">two</a> posts, the
oppposite hypothesis came up. The thought is that prestigious PhDs are
more likely to make stopovers in postdocs and fellowships before
arriving at the tenure track. But then, on the third hand, maybe less
prestigious PhDs are actually more likely to make stopovers, just in
less cushy temporary gigs.</p>

<p>So which is it: does PhD prestige shorten expected time to the tenure
track, or lengthen it?</p>

<p>Curiously, the answer so far seems to be: neither. If we use PGR ratings
to measure prestige, and data from the APDA homepage to measure
time-to-TT, there seems to be almost no connection. (Again, that&rsquo;s
assuming you <em>do</em> end up in a tenure-track job, which a prestigious PhD
does seem to help with at least a bit.)</p>

<p>Because this conclusion surprised me so much (and because it&rsquo;s likely to
be controversial, even weaponized in the PGR wars), I&rsquo;m going to make
this post way more pedantic than usual. I&rsquo;m going to walk through the
analysis one step at a time, and even show all the code.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this way, careful readers will catch and correct any errors.
And non-careful readers will be so turned off they&rsquo;ll shut up and go
away (instead of @-ing me with their volcanic takes on twitter or
stirring up shit elsewhere in the blogosphere).</p>

<p>Ok let&rsquo;s get started.</p>

<h1 id="setting-up">Setting Up</h1>

<p>As usual I&rsquo;m working in R, and since I&rsquo;m a <a href="http://hadley.nz/" target="_blank">Hadley</a>
stan we start by importing the <code>tidyverse</code> package. But we&rsquo;ll also
import the <code>tools</code> package for its <code>toTitleCase</code> function, so that we
can enforce consistent capitalization. We&rsquo;ll be combining data from two
different sources, the PGR and the APDA, so we&rsquo;ll need the names of PhD
programs capitalized the same way in order to <code>join</code> the two datasets
properly.</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">library(tidyverse)
library(tools)
</code></pre>

<p>Next we import the APDA data. This is the same data scraped from the
APDA homepage in my <a href="https://jonathanweisberg.org/post/page-rank-2/" target="_blank">last
post</a>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">df_apda &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/apda-2018-11-9.csv&quot;,
                    col_types = cols(
                      grad_program = col_character(),
                      id = col_character(),
                      year_graduated = col_character(),
                      aos = col_character(),
                      year = col_integer(),
                      placement_program = col_character(),
                      type = col_character()
                    ))
</code></pre>

<p>It needs a bit of cleaning: we standardize the capitalization, fix a few
typos&hellip; but we also filter out duplicate entries, entries where the
year of the placement is missing or unknown, and entries where the type
(TT/postdoc/etc.) is missing:</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">df_apda$grad_program &lt;- toTitleCase(df_apda$grad_program)

df_apda$year[df_apda$year == 19182] &lt;- 1982
df_apda$year[df_apda$year == 2104] &lt;- 2014

df_apda &lt;- df_apda %&gt;%
  distinct() %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(year)) %&gt;%
  filter(year_graduated != &quot;Current Student or Graduation Year Unknown&quot;) %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(type))

df_apda$year_graduated &lt;- as.integer(df_apda$year_graduated)
</code></pre>

<p>Next we calculate <code>time_to_tt</code> as follows: (i) filter out all but TT
placements, (ii) select the first placement (by year) for each graduate,
and (iii) subtract the year they graduated from that:</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">df_apda &lt;- df_apda %&gt;%
  filter(type == &quot;Tenure-Track&quot;) %&gt;%
  group_by(grad_program, id) %&gt;%
  arrange(year) %&gt;%
  slice(1) %&gt;%
  mutate(time_to_tt = year - year_graduated) %&gt;%
  ungroup()
</code></pre>

<p>For a glimpse of the results, here are ten randomly chosen entries:</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">set.seed(42)
sample_n(df_apda, 10) %&gt;% 
  select(grad_program, year_graduated, year, time_to_tt)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>## # A tibble: 10 x 4
##    grad_program                        year_graduated  year time_to_tt
##    &lt;chr&gt;                                        &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;
##  1 University of Virginia                        2011  2014          3
##  2 University of Wisconsin-Madison               2013  2016          3
##  3 New York University                           2016  2015         -1
##  4 University of Pittsburgh                      2014  2014          0
##  5 University of Edinburgh                       2015  2017          2
##  6 University of California, Davis               2003  2009          6
##  7 University of Minnesota Twin Cities           2011  2015          4
##  8 Emory University                              2007  2007          0
##  9 University of Illinois at Chicago             1996  2005          9
## 10 University of Memphis                         2012  2014          2
</code></pre>

<p>Now we import the PGR data:</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">df_pgr &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/pgr/pgr.csv&quot;, 
                   col_types = cols(program = col_character(),
                                    mean = col_double(), 
                                    locale = col_character(), 
                                    year = col_integer()))
</code></pre>

<p>A random glimpse again:</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">sample_n(df_pgr, 10)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>## # A tibble: 10 x 4
##    program                             mean locale       year
##    &lt;chr&gt;                              &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;int&gt;
##  1 University of British Columbia       3   Canada       2017
##  2 University of Missouri               2.2 US           2008
##  3 University of Wisconsin-Madison      3.2 US           2008
##  4 Ohio State University                3.1 US           2008
##  5 University of British Columbia       2.6 Canada       2011
##  6 York University                      1.8 Canada       2008
##  7 Washington University in St. Louis   3.3 US           2017
##  8 Florida State University             2.3 US           2014
##  9 University of Calgary                2.3 Canada       2017
## 10 University of Canterbury             1.5 Australasia  2008
</code></pre>

<p>Note that we have ratings from the last six iterations of the PGR here:
2006, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2014, 2017. So we can pair graduates with PGR
ratings from around the time they went on the market.</p>

<p>More precisely, we&rsquo;ll assign each graduate a <code>pgr_year</code> corresponding to
the latest report available the year they graduated. Unless they
graduated prior to 2006 in which case we just use the 2006 ratings:</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">pgr_years &lt;- unique(df_pgr$year)
df_apda &lt;- df_apda %&gt;%
  group_by(grad_program, id) %&gt;%
  mutate(pgr_year = ifelse(year_graduated &lt;= 2006,
                           2006,
                           max(pgr_years[pgr_years &lt;= year_graduated]))) %&gt;%
  ungroup()
</code></pre>

<p>(Yes yes we could get earlier PGR data but frankly I&rsquo;m too lazy to go
through all that again. Most of our graduates are from 2006 or later
anyway, virtually all are from 2000 or later, and PGR scores don&rsquo;t
change too much from iteration to iteration.)</p>

<p>Finally, we join our two tables together, matching by program name and
year:</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">df &lt;- df_apda %&gt;%
  inner_join(df_pgr, 
             by = c(&quot;grad_program&quot; = &quot;program&quot;, &quot;pgr_year&quot; = &quot;year&quot;))
</code></pre>

<p>Phew, ok! We finally have a table of graduates from PGR-ranked programs
who got TT jobs, along with the PGR-rating of their program around that
time, and the time it took them to land their first TT job:</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">sample_n(df, 10) %&gt;% select(grad_program, mean, time_to_tt)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>## # A tibble: 10 x 3
##    grad_program                                        mean time_to_tt
##    &lt;chr&gt;                                              &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;
##  1 University of Virginia                               2.7          1
##  2 Graduate Center of the City University of New York   3.6          3
##  3 Yale University                                      4            0
##  4 University of York                                   2.3          2
##  5 Cornell University                                   3.7          0
##  6 University of California, Los Angeles                4            0

<h1 id="results">Results</h1>

<p>So, is there any correlation between PGR score and time to TT? Let&rsquo;s
plot our data, with some random jitter added for visibility, and a LOESS
curve to capture trends:</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">ggplot(df, aes(mean, time_to_tt)) +
 geom_jitter() +
 xlab(&quot;PGR Rating&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Years to First TT Job&quot;) +
 geom_smooth(method = &quot;loess&quot;) +
 theme_minimal()
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/img/prestige-and-time-to-tt/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Wow, just&hellip; flat. Pretty much all the way across. And calculating the
correlation, we get basically zero:</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">cor(df$mean, df$time_to_tt)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>## [1] -0.03016805
</code></pre>

<p>There are some pretty weird anomalies though, like that outlier way out
at the top right. Who took over 50 years to get their first TT job?!?
Turns out that&rsquo;s David C. Makinson, author of the classic 1965 paper,
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/analys/25.6.205" target="_blank">&ldquo;The Paradox of the Preface&rdquo;</a>!</p>

<p>What on earth happened here? Makinson graduated from Oxford in 1965, and
recently took up a visiting professorship at LSE in 2017, a difference
of 52 years. That wasn&rsquo;t his first tenured gig of course. But it&rsquo;s the
only one listed in the APDA database.</p>

<p>I guess any analysis of this size is bound to include at leats a few
such errors. (Shut up, I&rsquo;m a dad.) But let&rsquo;s try to minimize them.</p>

<p>As a first stab, we might just cut out any extreme outliers, say all
points where <code>time_to_tt</code> came out less than -2 or greater than 8.</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">df2 &lt;- df %&gt;% filter(-2 &lt;= time_to_tt &amp; time_to_tt &lt;= 8)

ggplot(df2, aes(mean, time_to_tt)) +
 geom_jitter() +
 xlab(&quot;PGR Rating&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Years to First TT Job&quot;) +
 geom_smooth(method = &quot;loess&quot;) +
 theme_minimal()
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/img/prestige-and-time-to-tt/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Things look a bit less flat now. Maybe there&rsquo;s a slight dip in
time-to-TT once PGR rating gets above 3 or so. But if so, it looks very
small. And the overall correlation is again pretty much zero:</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">cor(df2$mean, df2$time_to_tt)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>## [1] -0.06784644
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, one more try. Things work differently in different parts of the
world. PhD programs and job markets differ in their practices between
the US and the UK, between the UK and the rest of Europe, etc. So let&rsquo;s
try looking at just the US (the largest locale we have data for and the
one I understand best):</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">df3 &lt;- df2 %&gt;% filter(locale == &quot;US&quot;)

ggplot(df3, aes(mean, time_to_tt)) +
 geom_jitter() +
 xlab(&quot;PGR Rating&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Years to First TT Job&quot;) +
 geom_smooth(method = &quot;loess&quot;) +
 theme_minimal()
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/img/prestige-and-time-to-tt/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Again, it looks like there&rsquo;s only a very slight dip as PGR rating
exceeds 3, with a correlation very close to zero:</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">cor(df3$mean, df3$time_to_tt)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>## [1] -0.06922355
</code></pre>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>We could go on slicing and dicing, and I don&rsquo;t by any means see this as
the last word. But my expectations have certainly been shaken up here.
If there is a connection between prestige and time-to-TT, the available
evidence suggests it&rsquo;s much weaker than I would have guessed, and
perhaps depends a lot on other factors.</p>

<p>Hopefully we&rsquo;ll get a clearer picture of all this as the APDA database
grows. Their focus so far <a href="http://placementdata.com:8182/the-philosophical-gourmet-report-and-placement/" target="_blank">has been on graduates from
2012&ndash;2016</a>.
So the earlier data is probably much less complete (see: Makinson). And
not enough time has passed yet for the 2012&ndash;2016 data to be as
informative about time-to-TT.</p>

<p>So even though this conclusion is striking, I still view it as
tentative. #JustOneStudy</p>
