<p>If you look at the little network diagram below, you&rsquo;ll probably
agree that $P$ is the most &ldquo;central&rdquo; node in some intuitive sense.</p>

<p><img src="/img/coherentism-1/fig3.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This post is about using a belief&rsquo;s centrality in the web of belief to
give a coherentist account of its justification. The more central a
belief is, the more justified it is.</p>

<p>But how do we quantify &ldquo;centrality&rdquo;? The rough idea: the more ways there
are to arrive at a proposition by following inferential pathways in the
web of belief, the more central it is.</p>

<p>Since we&rsquo;re coherentists today (for the next 10 minutes, anyway), cyclic
pathways are allowed here. If we travel
$P \rightarrow Q \rightarrow R \rightarrow P$, that counts as an
inferential path leading to $P$. And if we go around that cycle twice,
that counts as another such pathway.</p>

<p>You might think this just wrecks the whole idea. Every node has
infinitely many such pathways leading to it, after all. By cycling
around and around we can come up with literally any number of pathways
ending at a given node.</p>

<p>But, by examining how these pathways differ in the limit, we can
differentiate between more and less central nodes/beliefs. We can thus
clarify a sense in which $P$ is most central, and quantify that
centrality. We can even use that quantity to answer a classic objection
to coherentism leveled by <a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/KLEWPC" target="_blank">Klein &amp; Warfield
(1994)</a>.</p>

<p>As a bonus, we can do all this without ever giving an account of what
makes a corpus of beliefs &ldquo;coherent.&rdquo; This flips the script on a lot of
contemporary formal work on coherentism.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> Because coherentism is
holistic, you might think it has to evaluate the coherence of a whole
corpus first, before it can assess the individual members.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> But we&rsquo;ll
see this isn&rsquo;t so.

<h1 id="counting-pathways">Counting Pathways</h1>

<p>Our idea is to count how many paths there are leading to $P$ vs.Â other
nodes. We start with paths of length $1$, then count paths of length
$2$, then length $3$, and so on. As we count longer and longer paths,
each node&rsquo;s count approaches infinity.</p>

<p>But not their relative ratios! If, at each step, we divide the number of
paths ending at $P$ by the number of all paths, this ratio converges.</p>

<p>To find its limit, we represent our graph numerically. A graph can be
represented in a table, where each node corresponds to a row and column.
The columns represent &ldquo;sources&rdquo; and the rows represent &ldquo;targets.&rdquo; We put
a $1$ where the column node points to the row node, otherwise we put a
$0$.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>$P$</th>
<th>$Q$</th>
<th>$R$</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>$P$</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>$Q$</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>$R$</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Hiding the row and column names gives us a matrix we&rsquo;ll call $\A$: $$
\A =
\left[
  \begin{matrix}
    0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\<br />
    1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\<br />
    0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0
  \end{matrix}
\right].
$$ Notice how each row records the length-$1$ paths leading to the
corresponding node. There are two such paths to $P$, and one each to $Q$
and $R$.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>The key to counting longer paths is to take powers of $\A$. If we
multiply $\A$ by itself to get $\A^2$, we get a record of the length-$2$
paths: $$
\A^2 = \A \times \A = \left[
  \begin{matrix}
    0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\<br />
    1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\<br />
    0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0
  \end{matrix}
\right] \left[
  \begin{matrix}
    0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\<br />
    1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\<br />
    0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0
  \end{matrix}
\right] =
\left[
  \begin{matrix}
    1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\<br />
    0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\<br />
    1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
  \end{matrix}
\right].
$$ There are two such paths to $P$: $$
\begin{aligned}
  Q \rightarrow R \rightarrow P,\\<br />
  P \rightarrow Q \rightarrow P.
\end{aligned}
$$ Similarly for $Q$: $$
\begin{aligned}
  Q \rightarrow P \rightarrow Q,\\<br />
  R \rightarrow P \rightarrow Q.
\end{aligned}
$$ While $R$ has just one length-$2$ path:
$$ P \rightarrow Q \rightarrow R. $$ If we go on to examine $\A^3$, its
rows will tally the length-$3$ paths; in general, $\A^n$ tallies the
paths of length-$n$.</p>

<p>But we want relative ratios, not raw counts. The trick to getting these
is to divide $\A$ at each step by a special number $\lambda$, known as
the &ldquo;leading eigenvalue&rdquo; of $\A$ (details <a href="#tech">below</a>). If we take
the limit
$$ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left(\frac{\A}{\lambda}\right)^n $$ we
get a matrix whose columns all have a special property: $$
\left[
  \begin{matrix}
    0.41 &amp; 0.55 &amp; 0.31 \\<br />
    0.31 &amp; 0.41 &amp; 0.23 \\<br />
    0.23 &amp; 0.31 &amp; 0.18
  \end{matrix}
\right].
$$ They all have the same relative proportions. They&rsquo;re multiples of the
same &ldquo;frequency vector,&rdquo; a vector of positive values that sum to $1$: $$
\left[
  \begin{matrix}
    0.43 \\<br />
    0.32 \\<br />
    0.25 \\<br />
  \end{matrix}
\right].
$$ So as we tally longer and longer paths, we find that $43\%$ of those
paths lead to $P$, compared with $32\%$ for $Q$ and $25\%$ for $R$. Thus
$P$ is about $1.3$ times as justified as $Q$ ($.43/.32$), and about
$1.7$ times as justified as $R$ ($.43/.25$).</p>

<p>We want absolute degrees of justification though, not just comparative
ones. So we borrow a trick from probability theory and use a tautology
for scale.</p>

<p>We add a special node $\top$ to our graph, which every other node points
to, though $\top$ doesn&rsquo;t point back.</p>

<p><img src="/img/coherentism-1/fig4.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Updating our matrix $\A$ accordingly, we insert $\top$ in the first
row/column: $$
\A =
\left[
  \begin{matrix}
    0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\<br />
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\<br />
    0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\<br />
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0
  \end{matrix}
\right].
$$ Redoing our limit anlaysis gives us the vector
$(1.00, 0.57, 0.43, 0.33)$. But this isn&rsquo;t our final answer, because
it&rsquo;s actually not possible for the non-$\top$ nodes to get a value
higher than $2/3$ in a graph with just $3$ non-$\top$ nodes.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:4"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> So we
divide elementwise by $(1, 2/3, 2/3, 2/3)$ to scale things, giving us
our final result: $$
\left[
  \begin{matrix}
    1.00 \\<br />
    0.85 \\<br />
    0.65 \\<br />
    0.49
  \end{matrix}
\right].
$$ The relative justifications are the same as before, e.g. $P$ is still
$1.3$ times as justified as $Q$. But now we can make absolute
assessments too. $R$ comes out looking pretty bad ($0.49$), as seems
right, while $Q$ looks a bit better ($0.65$). Of course $P$ looks best
($0.85$), though maybe not quite good enough to be justified <em>tout
court</em>.</p>

<h1 id="the-klein-warfield-problem">The Klein&ndash;Warfield Problem</h1>

<p>Ok that&rsquo;s theoretically nifty and all, but does it work on actual cases?
Let&rsquo;s try it out by looking at a notorious objection to coherentism.
<a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/KLEWPC" target="_blank">Klein &amp; Warfield (1994)</a> argue that
coherentism flouts the laws of probability. How so?</p>

<p>Making sense of things often means believing more: taking on new beliefs
to resolve the tensions in our existing ones. For example, if we think
Tweety is a bird who can&rsquo;t fly, the tension is resolved if we also
believe they&rsquo;re a penguin.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:5"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup></p>

<p>But believing more means believing less probably. Increases in logical
strength bring decreases in probability (unless the stronger content was
already guaranteed with probability $1$). So increasing the coherence in
one&rsquo;s web of belief will generally mean decreasing its probability. How
could increasing coherence increase justification, then?</p>

<p><a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/MEROBO" target="_blank">Merricks (1995)</a> points out that,
even though the probability of the whole corpus goes down, the
probabilities of individual beliefs go up in a way. After all, it&rsquo;s more
likely Tweety can&rsquo;t fly if they&rsquo;re a penguin, than if they&rsquo;re just a
bird of some unknown species.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s only the beginning of a satisfactory answer though. After all, we
might not be justified in believing Tweety&rsquo;s a penguin in the first
place! Adding a new belief to support an existing belief doesn&rsquo;t help if
the new belief has no support itself. We need a more global assessment,
which is where the present account shines.</p>

<p>Suppose we add $P$ = <em>Tweety is a penguin</em> to the network containing $B$
= <em>Tweety is a bird</em> and $\neg F$ = <em>Tweety can&rsquo;t fly</em>. Will this
increase the centrality/justification of $B$ and of $\neg F$? Yes, but
we need to sort out the support relations to verify this.</p>

<p>Presumably $P$ supports $B$, and $\neg F$ too. But what about the other
way around? If Tweety is a flightless bird, there&rsquo;s a decent chance
they&rsquo;re a penguin. But it&rsquo;s hardly certain; they might be an emu or kiwi
instead. Come to think of it, isn&rsquo;t support a matter of degree, so don&rsquo;t
we need finer tools than just on/off arrows?</p>

<p>Yes, and the refinement is easy. We accommodate degrees of support by
attaching weights to our arrows. Instead of just placing a $1$ in our
matrix $\A$ wherever the column-node points to the row-node, we put a
number from the $[0,1]$ interval that reflects the strength of support.
The same limit analysis as before still works, as it turns out.
We just think of our inferential links as &ldquo;leaky pipes&rdquo; now, where
weaker links make for leakier pipelines.</p>

<p>We still need concrete numbers to analyze the Tweety example. But it&rsquo;s a
toy example, so let&rsquo;s just make up some plausible-ish numbers to get us
going. Let&rsquo;s suppose $1\%$ of birds are flightless, and birds are an
even smaller percentage of the flightless things, say $0.1\%$. Let&rsquo;s
also pretend that $20\%$ of flightless birds are penguins.</p>

<p>Before believing Tweety is a penguin then, our web of belief looks like
this:</p>

<p><img src="/img/coherentism-1/fig5a.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Calculating the degrees of justification for $B$ and $\neg F$, both come
out very close to $0$ as you&rsquo;d expect (with $B$ closer to $0$ than
$\neg F$). Now we add $P$.</p>

<p><img src="/img/coherentism-1/fig5b.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Recalculating degrees of justification, we find that they increase
drastically. $B$ and $F$ are now justified to degree $0.85$, while $P$
is justified to degree $0.26$. (All numbers approximate.)</p>

<p>So our account vindicates Merricks. Not only does adding $P$ to the
corpus add &ldquo;local&rdquo; justification for $B$ and for $\neg F$. It also
improves their standing on a more global assessment.</p>

<p>You might be worried though: did $P$ come out too weakly justified, at
just $0.26$? No: that&rsquo;s either an artifact of oversimplification, or
else it&rsquo;s actually the appropriate outcome. Notice that $B$ and $\neg F$
don&rsquo;t really support Tweety being a penguin. They&rsquo;re a flightless bird,
sure, but maybe they&rsquo;re an emu, kiwi, or moa. We chose to believe
penguin, and maybe we have our reasons. If we do, then the graph is
missing background beliefs which would improve $P$&rsquo;s standing once
added. But otherwise, we just fell prey to stereotyping or
comes-to-mind-bias, in which case it&rsquo;s right that $P$ stand poorly.</p>

<h1 id="tech">Technical Background</h1>

<p>The notion of centrality used here is a common tool in network analysis,
where it&rsquo;s known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvector_centrality" target="_blank">&ldquo;eigenvector
centrality.&rdquo;</a>
Because the frequency vector we arrive at in the limit is an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors" target="_blank">eigenvector</a>
of the matrix $\A$. In fact it&rsquo;s a special eigenvector, the only one
with all-positive values.</p>

<p>Since we&rsquo;re measuring justification on a $0$-to-$1$ scale, our account
depends on there always being such an eigenvector for $\A$. In fact we
need it to be unique, up to scaling (i.e.Â up to multiplication by a
constant).</p>

<p>The theorem that guarantees this is actually quite old, going back to
work by Oskar Perron and Georg Frobenius published around 1910. Here&rsquo;s one version of it.</p>

<p><strong>Perron&ndash;Frobenius Theorem.</strong> Let $\A$ be a square matrix whose entries
are all positive. Then all of the following hold.</p>

<ol>
<li>$\A$ has an eigenvalue $\lambda$ that is larger (in absolute value)
than $\A$&rsquo;s other eigenvalues. We call $\lambda$ the <em>leading
eigenvalue</em>.</li>
<li>$\A$&rsquo;s leading eigenvalue has an eigenvector $\v$ whose entries are
all positive. We call $\v$ the <em>leading eigenvector</em>.</li>
<li>$\A$ has no other positive eigenvectors, save multiples of $\v$.</li>
<li>The powers $(\A/\lambda)^n$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$ approach a
matrix whose columns are all multiples of $\v$.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, our matrices had some zeros, so they weren&rsquo;t positive in all their
entries. But it doesn&rsquo;t really matter, as it turns out.</p>

<p>Frobenius&rsquo; contribution was to generalize this result to many cases that
feature zeros. But even in cases where Frobenius&rsquo; weaker conditions
aren&rsquo;t satisfied, we can just borrow a trick from Google.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:6"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> Instead of
using a $0$-to-$1$ scale, we use $\epsilon$-to-$1$ for some very small
positive number $\epsilon$. Then all entries in $\A$ are guaranteed to
be positive, and we just rescale our results accordingly. (Choose
$\epsilon$ small enough and the difference is negligible in practice.)</p>

differently in the &ldquo;Technical Background&rdquo; section. And otherwise it
doesn&rsquo;t really affect our results. It increases the leading
eigenvalue by $1$, but doesn&rsquo;t affect the leading eigenvector.</p>
