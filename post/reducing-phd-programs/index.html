          <p>We think philosophy PhD programs should be reduced by about one half. Instead of producing around 3x as many PhDs as there are tenure-track jobs available in academic philosophy, we suggest 1.25x or 1.5x as a target.</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t mean shuttering half the PhD programs out there, necessarily. Each program could just train fewer PhDs. MA admissions could be expanded accordingly, for programs that need the TA labour.</p>

<p>Kevin Zollman argues against calls like ours in a recent post, for several reasons. These proposals are paternalistic; they shut the door in the face of aspiring philosophers; skills acquired doing a PhD transfer to jobs outside academic philosophy; and more.</p>

<p>Zollman makes some excellent points. Still, we disagree with his overall assessment.</p>

<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t shut out aspiring students without reason. But we already are shutting out many (most?) students, just at a later stage: post-PhD, after they&rsquo;ve invested 5â€“10 years of their lives&mdash;far from friends and family, usually&mdash;in a career that becomes, for many, central to their identity. Being shut out at that stage is extra painful. With the current trend toward multiple post-docs and VAPs, it also now comes after many years of wandering the world, uprooting again and again to work in temporary or insecure jobs.</p>

<p>Our proposal doesn&rsquo;t shut students out of an academic career. It only denies them the dissertation-phase of a PhD&mdash;the phase most likely to drag on indefinitely, and which in philosophy tends to be very isolating work.</p>

<p>What about skills? Writing a dissertation teaches one to organize a large project, to synthesize swaths of written material, and to work and think independently. But MA students already learn these skills, just on a smaller scale. The elephantine task of producing a dissertation is a very inefficient way to scale these skills up, to a level where they may never be needed anyway. Whatever skills a student does end up needing in their non-academic career, they can almost always learn  more efficiently <em>by starting on that career</em>.</p>

<p>Paternalism is a serious concern, but two counterpoints need to be considered. First, saturating the academic labour market with so many PhDs hurts those very students. It makes tenure-track jobs harder to get, escalating the stress and labour of getting a tenure-track job: publishing, postdocs, absurdly bespoke application materials, etc. In a hirer&rsquo;s market, prospective hirees suffer.</p>

<p>Students who do get hired then suffer in additional ways, since they have no leverage over their employers. We like to pretend that highly qualified and experienced faculty are irreplaceable, but really that&rsquo;s laughable. Faculty can be replaced in a heartbeat by someone cheaper, and with a longer CV in some cases! Universities know this, and they compensate and exploit their faculty accordingly.</p>

<p>Second, training PhD students takes resources away from undergraduates and MA students. More people apply for graduate study in philosophy than we admit. By what right do we deny them the opportunity? Presumably, on the grounds that we lack the resources to support them all. But we could go wider instead of deeper, denying some students the opportunity to dissertate, so that more can master. We can&rsquo;t avoid making such decisions for students, in fact it&rsquo;s part of our job.</p>

<p>Expanding MA programs could also improve the pipeline into the dissertation phase of the PhD. For example, students would have a more natural breakpoint at which to consider whether they really want to go for a doctorate/academic career. Many PhD programs offer students the option to depart with an MA after coursework. But this requires an active decision by the student, a decision that can feel like quitting, or being seen to quit. Changing the default changes this dynamic.</p>

<p>[Maybe insert something here about exploitation from your notes, as a closing argument?]</p>

<p>[There&rsquo;s lots more we could include, not really sure what to include/exclude at this point. Your thoughts?]</p>
