<p>Here&rsquo;s a striking result that caught me off guard the other day. It came up in a facebook thread, and judging by the discussion there it caught a few other people in this neighbourhood off guard too.</p>

<p>The short version: chances are &ldquo;self-expecting&rdquo; pretty much if and only if they&rsquo;re &ldquo;self-certain&rdquo;. Less cryptically: the chance of a proposition equals its expected chance just in case the chance function assigns probability 1 to itself being the true chance function, modulo an exception to be discussed below.</p>

<p>The same result applies to any probabilities of course, whether they represent physical chances or evidential probabilities or whatever. In fact, thanks to friends on facebook, I learned that it drives <a href="https://philpapers.org/archive/DOREAG.pdf" target="_blank">this lovely paper by Kevin Dorst</a>.</p>

<p>I just happened to stumble across it while thinking about chances, because Richard Pettigrew uses the assumption that chances are self-expecting in <a href="http://fitelson.org/coherence/pettigrew_chance.pdf" target="_blank">his <em>Phil Review</em> paper on accuracy and the Principal Principle</a>. But later, in <a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/PETAAT-7" target="_blank">his landmark book on accuracy</a>, he switches to the requirement that they be self-certain. It turns out this isn&rsquo;t a coincidence. The result we&rsquo;re about to look at illuminates this shift.</p>

<p>The result goes back to 1997 at least, in <a href="https://homepages.cwi.nl/~jve/books/oldgass/high-order-beliefs.pdf" target="_blank">a paper by Dov Samet</a>. Proving the full result is a bit more involved than what I&rsquo;ll present here. For simplicity, I&rsquo;ll only prove a special case at the end. But along the way we&rsquo;ll look at some suggestive examples that illustrate the full version.</p>

<h1 id="the-chance-matrix">The Chance Matrix</h1>

<p>Imagine we have just four possible worlds, resulting from two tosses of a coin. What are the physical chances at each of the four possible worlds $HH$, $HT$, $TH$, and $TT$? $\newcommand{\mstar}{\mathfrak{m}^*} \newcommand{\C}{\mathbf{C}}$</p>

<p>One natural thought is to apply Laplace&rsquo;s classic rule of succession: given $s$ heads out of $n$ tosses, conclude that the probability of heads on each toss is $(s+1)/(n+2)$. So at $HH$-world for example, the chance of heads was $3/ 4$ on each toss.</p>

<p>If we assume the tosses are independent, then $HH$-world had chance $(3/ 4)(3/ 4) = 9/16$ of being actual, according to the chance function at $HH$-world. Whereas $HT$-world had chance $(3/ 4)(1/ 4) = 3/16$ of being actual at $HH$-world. The full chance function at $HH$-world can be displayed as a column vector:
$$
\left(
    \begin{matrix}
        9/16\\<br />
        3/16\\<br />
        3/16\\<br />
        1/16
    \end{matrix}
\right).
$$
Applying the same recipe at $HT$-world would give us a different column vector. And sticking the columns for all four worlds together, we get a $4 \times 4$ <em>chance matrix</em> for our space of possible worlds:
$$
\mathbf{C} =
    \left(
        \begin{matrix}
            9/16 &amp; 1/ 4 &amp; 1/ 4 &amp; 1/16\\<br />
            3/16 &amp; 1/ 4 &amp; 1/ 4 &amp; 3/16\\<br />
            3/16 &amp; 1/ 4 &amp; 1/ 4 &amp; 3/16\\<br />
            1/16 &amp; 1/ 4 &amp; 1/ 4 &amp; 9/16
        \end{matrix}
    \right).
$$
Each column gives the chances <em>at</em> a world, while a row gives the chances <em>of</em> a world. For example, entry $c_{14}$ gives the chance <em>at</em> world $4$ <em>of</em> world $1$ being actual. It says how likely the sequence $HH$ was if the actual unfolding of events is instead $TT$, namely $1/16$.</p>

<p>A different thought would be to appeal to Carnap&rsquo;s notorious &ldquo;logical&rdquo; prior $\mstar$:
$$
\mstar =
    \left(
        \begin{matrix}
            1/3\\<br />
            1/6\\<br />
            1/6\\<br />
            1/3
        \end{matrix}
    \right).
$$
This assignment of probabilities ignores the actual unfolding of events in each world. It falls out of a bit of a priori reasoning instead. There are three possible outcomes: $2$ heads, $1$ head, or $0$ heads. Each is equally likely, $1/ 3$. But there are two ways to get $1$ head, so the $1/ 3$ there gets subdivided equally between $HT$ and $TH$, leaving $1/6$ for each.</p>

<p>Since these chances ignore the actual unfolding of events in each world, the chance matrix we get here is extremely anti-Humean. It&rsquo;s just four repetitions of $\mstar$:
$$
\mathbf{C} =
    \left(
        \begin{matrix}
            1/3 &amp; 1/3 &amp; 1/3 &amp; 1/3\\<br />
            1/6 &amp; 1/6 &amp; 1/6 &amp; 1/6\\<br />
            1/6 &amp; 1/6 &amp; 1/6 &amp; 1/6\\<br />
            1/3 &amp; 1/3 &amp; 1/3 &amp; 1/3
        \end{matrix}
    \right).
$$
You might think that&rsquo;s a pretty terrible theory of chance, and I sympathize. But what we&rsquo;re about to see is that, of our two chance matrices, only the second is &ldquo;self-expecting&rdquo;. And its terribleness is part of the reason why.</p>

<h1 id="self-expectation">Self Expectation</h1>

<p>Pettigrew&rsquo;s <em>Phil Review</em> paper assumes that chance functions are &ldquo;self-expecting&rdquo;. The chance of a proposition at a given world must equal its expected value, where the expectation is taken according to the chances at that world.</p>

<p>In terms of a chance matrix $\C$, this amounts to the requirement that $\C \C = \C$. When we multiply $\C$ by $\C$, we take dot-products of rows and columns. For example, if we were doing the calculation by hand, we&rsquo;d start by multiplying the first row of $\C$ by the first column of $\C$. And this is just the weighted average of the various possible chances <em>of</em> the first world, where the weights are the chances <em>at</em> that world. In other words, it&rsquo;s the expected chance <em>of</em> $HH$-world <em>at</em> $HH$-world.</p>

<p>In general, the dot product of row $i$ with column $j$ is the expected chance <em>of</em> world $i$ <em>at</em> world $j$. For this expected chance to equal the chance of world $i$ at world $j$, it must be that $\C \C = \C$. More succinctly, $\C^2 = \C$.</p>

<p>Matrices that have this property&mdash;squaring them leaves them unchanged&mdash;are called <em>idempotent</em>. And when our matrices are column stochastic (all values are nonnegative and each column sums to $1$), idempotence is a very&hellip; well, potent requirement.</p>

<p>For example, our first chance matrix based on Laplace&rsquo;s rule of succession is not idempotent. Its square is not itself, but something quite different. Our second, Carnapian matrix is idempotent though. Its square is just itself. And that&rsquo;s not a coincidence.</p>

<h1 id="self-certainty">Self Certainty</h1>

<p>Any chance matrix whose columns are redundant will be idempotent. After all, if the chances are the same <em>at</em> every world, the expected value <em>of</em> any world is always the same. So its expected value just is the value it has at every world.</p>

<p>But redundant columns also mean that the chances are <em>self certain</em>. Each world&rsquo;s chance assignment gives zero probability to the chances being anything other than what they are at that world. Because there <em>are</em> no worlds where the chances are different.</p>

<p>The chances can vary from world to world and still be self-expecting though. There are idempotent chance matrices where the columns are not simply redundant. For example, here&rsquo;s another idempotent chance matrix:
$$
\left(
    \begin{matrix}
        1/3 &amp; 1/3 &amp; 0      &amp;    0\\<br />
        2/3 &amp; 2/3 &amp; 0      &amp;    0\\<br />
            0 &amp;   0 &amp; 1/ 4 &amp; 1/ 4\\<br />
            0 &amp;   0 &amp; 3/ 4 &amp; 3/ 4
    \end{matrix}
\right).
$$
But notice how it&rsquo;s still kind of a degenerate case. There are two, disjoint regions of modal space here that regard one another as zero-chance. And within each region the chances are the same at each world. Worlds $1$ and $2$ have the same chances, and they give zero chance to worlds $3$ and $4$. And vice versa from the point of view of worlds $3$ and $4$.</p>

<p>In other words, self-expectation and self-certainty go hand in hand here once again.</p>

<h1 id="a-sliver-of-daylight">A Sliver of Daylight</h1>

<p>Is there any daylight at all then between self-expectation and self-certainty?</p>

<p>Self-certainty entails self-expectation, and the argument is pretty short. If the only worlds with positive chance according to world $j$ assign the same chances as world $j$ does, then any average of those chances will just be those same chances.</p>

<p>But self-expectation doesn&rsquo;t <em>quite</em> entail self-certainty. For example, here&rsquo;s an idempotent chance matrix that&rsquo;s not self-certain:
$$
\left(
    \begin{matrix}
        1/3 &amp; 1/3 &amp; 0      &amp;    0 &amp; 25/94\\<br />
        2/3 &amp; 2/3 &amp; 0      &amp;    0 &amp; 25/47\\<br />
            0 &amp;   0 &amp; 1/ 4 &amp; 1/ 4 &amp; 19/376\\<br />
            0 &amp;   0 &amp; 3/ 4 &amp; 3/ 4 &amp; 57/376\\<br />
            0 &amp;   0 &amp;    0 &amp;    0 &amp; 0
    \end{matrix}
\right).
$$
It&rsquo;s kind of a lame counterexample though, because the new, fifth world we&rsquo;ve introduced (the coin explodes or something idk) has zero chance at every world, even itself.</p>

<p>In fact this is what Samet proves: this is the only kind of counterexample possible! If probabilities are self-expecting, then they must be either self-certain or self-effacing. They must assign zero chance to the chances being otherwise, or they must assign chance one to them being otherwise.</p>

<p>In terms of matrices, there are only three kinds of idempotent chance matrix:</p>

<ol>
<li>All columns are identical.</li>
<li>The matrix is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_matrix#Block_diagonal_matrices" target="_blank">block diagonal</a>, with identical columns inside each block.</li>
<li>The matrix is as in (2), except for some columns $j_1, \ldots, j_n$. But the corresponding rows $j_1, \ldots, j_n$ contain only zeros.</li>
</ol>

<p>Strictly speaking (1) is actually a special case of (2). But (1) deserves direct attention because it arises in a way that&rsquo;s interesting both philosophically and mathematically.</p>

<h1 id="the-connected-case">The Connected Case</h1>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a natural thought, one that&rsquo;s driven a lot of the literature on chance and Lewis&rsquo; Principal Principle. The thought: however events unfold at one world, there&rsquo;s a chance they could have evolved differently. There&rsquo;s even some small, non-zero chance they could have evolved quite differently.</p>

<p>Taking this thought a bit further, you might think there&rsquo;s a region of modal space where, even though worlds $w_1$ and $w_n$ have different chances, $w_n$ is always reachable from world $w_1$. More exactly, there&rsquo;s always a connecting sequence of worlds $w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n$ where $w_i$ gives non-zero chance to $w_{i+1}$.</p>

<p>In terms of coin tosses, maybe it&rsquo;s a law of nature that all coins land heads when all hundred out of one hundred flips land heads. But when there&rsquo;s a mix of heads and tails, there&rsquo;s at least some chance the mix could have had a few more heads, or a few more tails. So every world where the sequence isn&rsquo;t perfectly uniform can be reached from every other. If not in a single, positive-chance hop, then at least by a series of hops, perhaps by switching the outcomes of the flips one at a time for example.</p>

<p>In terms of graphs, such a region of modal space is said to be <em>connected</em>. In terms of matrices, it amounts to the chance matrix for this region being <em>regular</em>: there must be some power $n$ such that $\C^n$ contains all positive entries.</p>

<p>Now, regular matrices have the remarkable property that, as we multiply them against themselves more and more times, the result converges to a matrix $\mathbf{P}$ whose columns are all identical:
$$ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \C^n = \mathbf{P} =
\left(
    \begin{matrix}
        p_1    &amp; \ldots &amp; p_1    \\<br />
        \vdots &amp; \ldots &amp; \vdots \\<br />
        p_k    &amp; \ldots &amp; p_k    \\<br />
    \end{matrix}
\right).
$$
Now recall that for $\C$ to be self-expecting, it must be idempotent, meaning $\C^2 = \C$. But that means $\C^n = \C$ for any power $n$. But then $\C = \mathbf{P}$, so $\C$ must already have redundant columns.</p>

<p>What does this mean for us? One way to think about it: there isn&rsquo;t as much room for chances to vary from world to world as one might have thought. If the chances are going to be self-expecting, they must be the same at every world across a whole region modal space despite the facts turning out quite differently at various worlds across that region.</p>

<p>This point is strongly reminiscent of David Lewis&rsquo; famous &ldquo;Big Bad Bug&rdquo; of course. And there&rsquo;s tons of relevant literature, most of which I confess I never really absorbed. So I&rsquo;ll link to one paper I&rsquo;m finding especially helpful on this right now, Richard Pettigrew&rsquo;s <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-Gzj6gcSXKrcW5MeUhIN2Jsd1k/view" target="_blank">&ldquo;What Chance-Credence Norms Should Not Be&rdquo;</a>.</p>
